# march-madness

## Description
This application predicts the results of the NHL playoffs (using seedings 1-8 for East and West Conferences) 

This is similar to my march madness script, but only use the round of 16 on and rename the "regions" instead to the East and West Conferences (until the final matchup)

Needs refactoring (poorly structured)
